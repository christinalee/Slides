## We have a networking layer that mostly works but is hard to modify and is based on technologies from 5 years ago expert?

note:
- which makes it all look easy

!!!

# Let's do a trial!

note: 
- not going to wholesale swap willy nilly
- need test case and validation to get approval

!!!

note: 
- but what?
- if you're like us, you have several modules that separate network calls based on features

note: this begs the question which one do you choose?

note: now's a good time to mention

!!!

# Account API

note: 
- I chose the account API because AUTH AND UNAUTH!
- I was thinking about this from a technical perspective, not a practical one

!!!

# Feed API

note: 
- but what this ignored was that our feed was the most important litmus test
- once I completed the account api there were still a lot of unknowns
- spend more time on this, choose wisely for maximum learning

!!!

## Lesson 1: Choose your test case with care

!!!

## Lesson 2: There will be startup costs
todo: maybe you aren't as dumb as me, but I forgot I'd need to impl oauth
todo: budget time for everyone to offer opinions about volley, OkHTTP on its own, and retrofit

!!!

some bridge

# Lesson 3: Don't hate the player, hate the switch

!!!

```
public static void login(/*params*/, /*handler*/) {
	// some logic
	switch (params.getType()) {
		case SignupParams.TYPE_FACEBOOK:
			paramsMap.put("fb_id", params.fbId);
			paramsMap.put("fb_token", params.fbToken);
			path = "facebook/";
			break;
		case SignupParams.TYPE_EMAIL:
			path = "email/";
			break;
		...
	}
	// more logic
}
```

note: 
- because building out products happens iteratively, you most likely have something like this
- common form of networking tech debt
- write a login, then add more ways to login and expand the original func
- there are two main issues with this

!!!

```
if (params.emailAddress != null) {
	paramsMap.put("email", params.emailAddress);
}
if (params.username != null) {
	paramsMap.put("username", params.username);
}
if (params.password != null) {
	paramsMap.put("password", params.password);
}
```

note:
- issue 1: you get code like this
- different login types require different args so can't make them all mandatory

!!!

# "We're a package deal!"

note: 
- issue 2: login types are closely coupled for no good reason
- modifying facebook login can very possibly break email login

!!!

```
@FormUrlEncoded
@POST("something/facebook/")
fun facebookSignup(
  @Field("facebook_id") facebookId: String,
  @Field("facebook_token") facebookToken: String,
) : Observable<T>

@FormUrlEncoded
@POST("something/twitter/")
fun twitterSignup(
  @Field("twitter_id") twitterId: String,
  @Field("twitter_token") twitterToken: String,
  @Field("twitter_token_secret") twitterTokenSecret: String,
) : Observable<T>
```

note: 
- we're good citizens, so let's fix this/break these up

!!!

# Hurray! We win!

note: 
- cool, this seems objectively better

!!!

# But...

note: 
- shared logic across login events

!!!

# Where do we put shared behavior now?

note:
- not for me to say, developer dependent
- but you'll need to think about this

!!!

## When adding Retrofit retroactively, switches will be among your most time intensive migrations.

note: this is not a problem when you build with it from the start

!!!

# Lesson 3 (soon to be obsolete): Check your Rx

note: 
- one of the benefits of Retrofit is exposing streams
- this was a big reason we wanted to adopt it

!!!

## Are you an Rx1 holdout?

!!!

```
packagingOptions {
  exclude 'META-INF/rxjava.properties'
}
```

note:
- not retrofit explicit
- rx1 and rx2 include the same file

!!!

# Phew!

note: but theres more

!!!

```
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unable to create call 
  adapter for io.reactivex.Observable<T<Map<U, V>>>
```

!!!

``` 
compile 'com.squareup.retrofit2:adapter-rxjava2:2.2.0'
```

```
Retrofit.Builder()
                .addCallAdapterFactory(RxJava2CallAdapterFactory.create())
```

!!!

# Lesson 4: With great interceptor power, comes great interceptor responsibility

!!!

## Background: We already used OkHttp

note:
- but like most things, it didn't start that way and was added later
- focus on going from Apache to OkHttp
- didn't take advantage of interceptors even though we could have

!!!

## Interceptors: 

- usually used to add/remove/change headers
- can also be used for crazy shenanigans like <a href="https://publicobject.com/2016/01/17/sneaking-data-into-an-okhttp-interceptor/">this</a>
