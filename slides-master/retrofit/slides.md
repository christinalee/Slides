## We have a networking layer that mostly works but is hard to modify and is based on technologies from 5 years ago expert?

note:
- which makes it all look easy

!!!

# Let's do a trial!

note: 
- not going to wholesale swap willy nilly
- need test case and validation to get approval

note: 
- but what?
- if you're like us, you have several modules that separate network calls based on features

note: this begs the question which one do you choose?

note: now's a good time to mention

!!!

# Account API

note: 
- I chose the account API because AUTH AND UNAUTH!
- I was thinking about this from a technical perspective, not a practical one

!!!

# Feed API

note: 
- but what this ignored was that our feed was the most important litmus test
- once I completed the account api there were still a lot of unknowns
- spend more time on this, choose wisely for maximum learning

!!!

## Lesson 1: Choose your test case with care

!!!

## Lesson 2: "Modern" is not an end state
todo

!!!

some bridge

!!!

# Lesson 3: Don't hate the player, hate the switch

!!!

```
public static void login(/*params*/, /*handler*/) {
	// some logic
	switch (params.getType()) {
		case SignupParams.TYPE_FACEBOOK:
			paramsMap.put("fb_id", params.fbId);
			paramsMap.put("fb_token", params.fbToken);
			path = "facebook/";
			break;
		case SignupParams.TYPE_EMAIL:
			path = "email/";
			break;
		...
	}
	// more logic
}
```

note: 
- because building out products happens iteratively, you most likely have something like this
- common form of networking tech debt
- write a login, then add more ways to login and expand the original func
- there are two main issues with this

!!!

```
if (!StringUtils.isEmpty(params.emailAddress)) {
	paramsMap.put("email", params.emailAddress);
}
if (params.username != null) {
	paramsMap.put("username", params.username);
}
if (params.password != null) {
	paramsMap.put("password", params.password);
}
```

note:
- issue 1: you get code like this
- different login types require different args so can't make them all mandatory
