# We could not move fast enough with our current tools

!!!

## Why?

- Android:
	- no limit on apk uploads
	- slow adoption

!!!

## Why?

- iOS:
	- adoption is good 
	- review times can be long
	- possibility of rejection

note: app times have come down drammatically, but in the past, when we were developing, they could be up to two weeks
can also have updates be rejected, and we often did, so things are further of your control

# Solved Problems

### 1) Code push

### 2) Shared codebase
